Rails Sessionless Auth Example
===

This is heavily inspired / copied from [knock](https://github.com/nsarno/knock) library and the login-as-a-service provider [auth0](https://auth0.com/). I am doing this to learn, not to make an amazing product, so you are better off using auth0 than copying from this example.
